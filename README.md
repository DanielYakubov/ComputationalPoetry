This project is both a bit of a joke quite serious at the same time as I love poetry. 

# elevator.py

There is a quite famous poem called "Elevator" by Mark Strand. It's perhaps my favorite example of repetition being used in poetry. Oftentimes in poetry, repetition is used for emotional effect, or irony -- but in "Elevator", the meaning of the poem is the repetition itself.

The poem repeats the stanza twice (each time numbered, 1 and 2). This repo remixes this poem and instead makes it repeat an infinite amount of times, the poem is printed at 14.69ms per char, per Demberg & Keller (2008). My current record of running it locally is a measly 226, but I may consider running this on a server at some point. Why? It's a form of art, so why not? 

Note the part that says 'infinite' -- there's a while-true loop in this script, so be mindful if you choose to run it.

# infinite_monkey.py

A play on the ["Infinite Monkey Theorem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). The idea is you initialize X monkies that have a 1 in N chance of being freed from typing forever. 

But what happens to the last monkey?
