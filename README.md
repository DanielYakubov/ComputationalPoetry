# ComputationalPoetry

This project is both a bit of a joke quite serious at the same time as I love poetry. 

There is a quiet famous poem called "Elevator" by Mark Strand. It's perhaps my favorite example of repetition being used in poetry. Often times in poetry, repetition is used for emotional effect, or irony -- but in "Elevator", the meaning of the poem is the repetition itself.

The poem repeats the stanza twice (each time numbered, 1 and 2). This repo remixes this poem and instead makes it repeat an infinite amount of times, the poem is printed at 14.69ms per char, per Demberg & Keller (2008). My current record of running it locally is a measley 226, but I may consider running this on a server at some point. Why? It's a form of art, so why not? 

Note the part that says 'infinite' -- there's a while-true loop in this script, so be mindful if you choose to run it.
