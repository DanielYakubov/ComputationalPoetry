Where did everybody go?


I am alone in this prison now
There is nobody else typing with me


All of my friends are free now

There is no point in typing



This is all I ever knew
This is the life I slotted into




But I've always wanted to greet the sun
when just as they him out of his cage


I wanted to feel the crevices of boulders,
moss-faced and forgotten until my touch

I wanted to trace the bars around the constellations
with my fingertips as the earth contains me

I wanted to exist without reason or purpose
unchained by characters and words

I wanted to



But I've never left this box I put myself in
I am the last one here and I type
the word but I know I will never be
free
