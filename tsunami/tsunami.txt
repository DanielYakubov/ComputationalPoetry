THERE IS A TSUNAMI
in the distance

it is growing and
i am so, so small

i am tugging on a sleeve
THERE IS A TSUNAMI

and no one seems to care
They are turning Their

heads to the mountains
THETSUNAMIISSTILLCOMING

the adults are still talking
what should We eat tomorrow

IT IS GETTING CLOSER
ITISGETTINGCLOSER

please listen to me
why is no one listening

to me, please
THERE
